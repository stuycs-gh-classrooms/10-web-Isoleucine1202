### BODS (biology olympiads discord server) website in-progress
### Mr. Dyrland Weaver: I am assuming you are reading this (hoping, at least) and would like to comment that I am not submitting the pages listed as guides.html or txtbooks.html. If you would like to access Resources and Olympiads (resources.html and oly.html) then please click the text with that button- I am taking advantage of this project as an opportunity to get started on a site I have been intending to create for a very long time now and although those will be pages in the future, as of this very moment, they have no use nor content.
